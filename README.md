# Chocolatey Packages

## Chocolatey Packages Template

This contains Chocolatey packages, both manually and automatically maintained.

### Folder Structure

* automatic - where automatic packaging and packages are kept. These are packages that are automatically maintained using [chocolatey-au](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-au).
* icons - Where you keep icon files for the packages. This is done to reduce issues when packages themselves move around.
* manual - where packages that are not automatic are kept.

### Requirements

* Chocolatey (choco.exe)

#### AU

* PowerShell v5+.
* The [chocolatey-au module](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-au).
